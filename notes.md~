# Distributed tile processing w/ GeoTrellis and spark.

# Describe the challenges
 - Describe the climate data set
 - Describe the OTM data sets

# Describe the technologies
 - GeoTrellis: a scala library for doing anything geospatial
 - Spark: Cluster computing

# How we store tiles
 - Distributed Data Stores: Accumulo and HDFS

# Ingesting tiles
 - Describe the process. Show what it looks like.
 - Example: ingesting the housing vacancy raster.
   - Tile using GDAL gdal_retile.py
   - Upload to S3 in chunks of GeoTIFFS
   - Reproject the tiles
